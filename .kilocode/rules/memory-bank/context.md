# Current Context

## Current Work Focus

**Homebrew Cask Name Fix**: ✅ **PROJECT COMPLETED** - Fixed cask naming mismatches causing unnecessary application removals during nix-refresh:

- ✅ Identified root cause: Configuration used shortened names (`docker`, `syncthing`, `tailscale`) vs actual cask names (`docker-desktop`, `syncthing-app`, `tailscale-app`)
- ✅ Updated nix/darwin.nix with correct cask names to prevent removal/reinstallation cycles
- ✅ Verified configuration builds successfully with `make test`

**Previous Achievement**: GitHub Workflows Enhancement completed - Added comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with automated code quality validation.

**Previous Achievement**: MCPM Cleanup completed - Complete removal of Multi-Cloud Package Manager from dotfiles configuration.

**Previous Achievement**: ZSH Directory Cleanup and Migration completed - All 4 steps successfully implemented with legacy shell scripts migrated to declarative Nix configuration.

**Previous Achievement**: Kilocode extension integration stabilized with workaround for symlink handling bug implemented via activation scripts.

## Project Status

### Active Configurations

- **tennyson**: Personal development machine with full macOS configuration
  - Additional tools: Android development (NDK, Studio), Obsidian, Calibre, Zed editor
  - Cloud tools: Mountain Duck, ProtonVPN, KopiaUI backup
- **bst**: Work machine with streamlined configuration
  - Development tools: DBeaver, Linear, Graphite CLI
  - Custom Nix build group configuration (gid: 30000)

### Current System State

- **Architecture**: Nix flakes-based with automatic host discovery working reliably
- **Services**: Qdrant and Ollama configured as launchd user agents with proper logging
- **Development Environment**: Full stack with Vim (35+ plugins), Zsh, Git (25+ aliases), and Tmux
- **Quality Assurance**: Pre-commit hooks with shellcheck and formatting validation. **Testing Pattern**: Always use `make test` for comprehensive Nix configuration testing (manual trigger required), and `pre-commit run --all-files` for code quality validation.
- **Editor Integration**: VS Code with Kilocode MCP servers (context7, fetch, github) configured

## Recent Changes

### Renovate Configuration Migration (Final Syntax)

- Renovate configuration migrated from external `github.com/nalabelle/renovate-config` to local [`git/renovate/default.json5`](git/renovate/default.json5:1)
- **Final working configuration:** Both [`renovate.json`](renovate.json:1) and [`git/template/renovate.json`](git/template/renovate.json:1) now extend `github>nalabelle/dotfiles//git/renovate/default.json5`
- Uses the full path including filename (no colon `:` preset notation), which avoids the "Sub-presets cannot be combined with a custom path" error
- Directly resolves to the `git/renovate/default.json5` file, maintaining the organized git/ directory structure and JSON5 format
- All references to the old repository removed; preset resolution path validated for monorepo support
- Eliminates dependency on a separate renovate-config repository, centralizing all configuration within dotfiles
- Maintains same Renovate functionality for all template-based projects
- **Technical solution:** Use `github>nalabelle/dotfiles//git/renovate/default.json5` as the extend path in all Renovate configs

#### Timezone Support and Schedule

- Added `"timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"` to [`git/renovate/default.json5`](git/renovate/default.json5:1)
- Renovate schedule now runs **1 AM to 5 AM Pacific Time (America/Los_Angeles) on Saturdays** (`* 1-5 * * 6`)
- All schedule interpretation now happens in Pacific Time instead of UTC
- Documentation updated to clarify Pacific Time scheduling
- **Benefits:** Runs during low-traffic hours, completes before typical work hours on Saturday, and aligns with likely developer timezone

### Kilocode Integration Stabilized

- Workaround implemented for Kilocode extension symlink exclusion bug
- Activation script pattern using `rsync --update` for efficient file copying
- MCP server configuration with host-specific override capability

### Configuration Management

- Auto-discovery system proven reliable across both host configurations
- Fallback mechanisms working for both darwin and home-manager configurations
- Cross-platform compatibility maintained and tested via Docker deployment

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Memory Bank Validation**: Verify updated memory bank accuracy through practical usage
2. **Configuration Stability**: Monitor system reliability across both host configurations
3. **Performance Optimization**: Review activation script efficiency and resource usage

### Potential Areas for Enhancement

- **Additional Hosts**: Framework ready for adding new host configurations
- **Service Expansion**: Pattern established for adding new launchd services
- **Tool Integration**: Module system supports easy addition of new development tools
- **Testing Enhancement**: Expand Docker-based Linux testing for broader compatibility

## Important Notes

- **System Architecture**: Host-specific configurations override base settings through dedicated directories
- **Update Pattern**: `nix-refresh` script handles both darwin and home-manager updates with intelligent fallbacks
- **Quality Controls**: Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality before configuration changes are committed. Running `pre-commit run --all-files` is **required** after any configuration changes to validate:
  - Shell script syntax and style via shellcheck
  - File format validation (JSON, YAML, TOML, XML)
  - Basic file hygiene (trailing whitespace, line endings, etc.)
  - **Note**: Nix configuration testing moved to manual `make test` trigger
- **Service Management**: AI/ML services (Qdrant, Ollama) auto-start and maintain persistent storage

## Configuration Patterns

- **Git Workflow**: 25+ productivity aliases optimized for branch management and rebasing workflows
- **Vim Setup**: 35+ plugins with language-specific support and productivity enhancements
- **Shell Environment**: Zsh with Starship prompt, intelligent completion, and cross-platform compatibility
- **Development Tools**: DevBox, direnv, and project-specific environment isolation
