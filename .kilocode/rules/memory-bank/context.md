# Current Context

## Current Work Focus

**Stable Operational State**: System is in full operational mode with all major configurations stabilized. Recent Kilocode extension integration completed with workaround for symlink handling bug implemented via activation scripts.

## Project Status

### Active Configurations

- **tennyson**: Personal development machine with full macOS configuration
  - Additional tools: Android development (NDK, Studio), Obsidian, Calibre, Zed editor
  - Cloud tools: Mountain Duck, ProtonVPN, KopiaUI backup
  - Package manager: MCPM configured
- **bst**: Work machine with streamlined configuration
  - Development tools: DBeaver, Linear, Graphite CLI
  - Package manager: MCPM configured
  - Custom Nix build group configuration (gid: 30000)

### Current System State

- **Architecture**: Nix flakes-based with automatic host discovery working reliably
- **Services**: Qdrant and Ollama configured as launchd user agents with proper logging
- **Development Environment**: Full stack with Vim (35+ plugins), Zsh, Git (25+ aliases), and Tmux
- **Quality Assurance**: Pre-commit hooks with shellcheck, formatting, and Nix build validation
- **Editor Integration**: VS Code with Kilocode MCP servers (context7, fetch, github) configured

## Recent Changes

### Kilocode Integration Stabilized

- Workaround implemented for Kilocode extension symlink exclusion bug
- Activation script pattern using `rsync --update` for efficient file copying
- MCP server configuration with host-specific override capability

### Configuration Management

- Auto-discovery system proven reliable across both host configurations
- Fallback mechanisms working for both darwin and home-manager configurations
- Cross-platform compatibility maintained and tested via Docker deployment

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Memory Bank Validation**: Verify updated memory bank accuracy through practical usage
2. **Configuration Stability**: Monitor system reliability across both host configurations
3. **Performance Optimization**: Review activation script efficiency and resource usage

### Potential Areas for Enhancement

- **Additional Hosts**: Framework ready for adding new host configurations
- **Service Expansion**: Pattern established for adding new launchd services
- **Tool Integration**: Module system supports easy addition of new development tools
- **Testing Enhancement**: Expand Docker-based Linux testing for broader compatibility

## Important Notes

- **System Architecture**: Host-specific configurations override base settings through dedicated directories
- **Update Pattern**: `nix-refresh` script handles both darwin and home-manager updates with intelligent fallbacks
- **Quality Controls**: Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality before configuration changes are committed
- **Service Management**: AI/ML services (Qdrant, Ollama) auto-start and maintain persistent storage

## Configuration Patterns

- **Git Workflow**: 25+ productivity aliases optimized for branch management and rebasing workflows
- **Vim Setup**: 35+ plugins with language-specific support and productivity enhancements
- **Shell Environment**: Zsh with Starship prompt, intelligent completion, and cross-platform compatibility
- **Development Tools**: DevBox, direnv, and project-specific environment isolation
