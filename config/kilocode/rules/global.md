Common guidelines for all projects.

## Guidelines

- Follow the project's coding style and conventions.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to check for linting and formatting issues before considering a task done. Fix any issues that arise. This will also run build and tests.
- If there's no pre-commit config, prompt the user about whether one needs to be added.
